The Logistic Regression model was chosen for the "Hill and Valley Prediction" project to classify terrain plots based on 100 data points. This model is particularly suitable for binary classification tasks where the objective is to distinguish between two classes: in this case, identifying whether a given set of data points forms a "hill" (bump) or a "valley" (dip).The model was trained using the training portion of the dataset. During training, the Logistic Regression algorithm adjusted the coefficients Î² to maximize the likelihood of the correct classification of the data points in the training set.After training, the model's performance was evaluated using a separate test set that the model had not seen before.

The model performs very well in identifying class 0, with a high recall and moderate precision, leading to a decent F1-score of 0.77. For class 1, the model is highly precise but struggles with recall, meaning it often fails to identify actual positives, leading to a lower F1-score of 0.59. Overall, the model achieves an accuracy of 71%, but the imbalance between the performance on the two classes suggests room for improvement, especially in increasing the recall for class 1.
